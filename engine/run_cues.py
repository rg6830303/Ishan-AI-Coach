"""Cue *timing* engine for the one-way during-run coach.

This is the "when does the coach speak, and about what" brain — the running
equivalent of Google Maps deciding *now* is the moment to say "in 200 metres,
turn left". The runner can't talk back, so the engine has to be judicious:
say the right thing at the right instant, and — just as importantly — STAY
SILENT when the runner is in flow, because a coach that talks constantly is a
coach the runner mutes.

It consumes `engine.run_state.RunnerState` and emits at most one `CueEvent` per
telemetry tick. The event carries only a deterministic numeric payload; the
persona wording is applied later by `coaching.cue_library`. No LLM here.

Anti-irritation design (the core of the spec's "user must not get irritated"):
  1. MIN_GAP_S minimum spacing between any two spoken cues (safety bypasses it).
  2. A priority ladder: SAFETY > PACE_CORRECTION > MILESTONE > MOTIVATION.
  3. Per-trigger cooldowns so the same nudge never repeats in a tight window.
  4. Flow-state gating: when the runner is locked in (need == NONE), only
     milestones and safety may speak; coaching chatter is suppressed.
  5. One-shot markers (start, halfway, each km, final push, finish) fire once.
